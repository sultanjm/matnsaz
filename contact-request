Hi Sultan â€“ I'm the person who built the original repository this one was forked off. At the moment my repository is private, so you're not getting new updates. Would you be okay deleting this fork for the moment? I've open-sourced the most useful components as other repositories which are easier to use. And since some of the components are shared there will likely be some confusion so I just wanted to keep things easy. Since you hadn't added your own features yet I thought I'd ask.
Thanks. Please feel free to get in touch, I'm happy to share learnings.

Best,
Zeerak.
