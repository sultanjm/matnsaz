# The Matnsaz Keyboard for iOS

The Matnsaz Keyboard is a collectively-owned experiment into the development of Urdu Keyboards. This codebase has been designed for flexibility and legibility to allow for iteration and collaboration. If you'd like to contribute feel free to submit a pull request, or get in touch with the developer at me at zeerak dot net.
