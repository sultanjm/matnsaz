Hi Sultan â€“ I'm the person who built the original repository this one was forked off. I've open-sourced the most useful components as other repositories which are easier to use. And since some of the components are shared there will likely be some confusion with two versions of the same code lying around. Would you be open to deleting this fork? Since you hadn't added your own features yet I thought I'd ask.

Thanks. Please feel free to get in touch, I'm happy to share learnings.

Best,
Zeerak.
